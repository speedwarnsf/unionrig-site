Generate a mechanically accurate exploded assembly rendering of ONLY the Chaincraft v1 4.2-inch portrait e-ink display subsystem. This is an engineering design review artifact, not concept art.

INCLUDE ONLY: CNC aluminum top shell segment with display cutout + internal ledge (rabbet), clamp frame (retention bezel), 4.2" e-ink panel (portrait), 0.5mm compression gasket, controller PCB, 8mm metal standoffs, 4× M2 screws, FPC cable with service loop.

DISPLAY (non-negotiable):
- Portrait orientation only
- Active area: 84.8mm (H) × 63.6mm (W)
- Overall glass/module envelope: ~91 × 77mm
- Glass thickness ~1.3mm

TOP SHELL MACHINING:
- Machined ledge depth 1.8mm
- Ledge land width 2.5–3.5mm around perimeter
- Reveal gap/shadow line 0.25–0.40mm per side between aluminum and clamp frame
- Display rests on ledge (ledge supports load); clamp frame prevents lift

RETENTION (locked):
- Clamp frame thickness 2.5mm
- 4× M2 screws into aluminum bosses

CONTROLLER PCB:
- PCB thickness 1.6mm
- Mounted on 8mm standoffs
- ≥2.0mm clearance between top of PCB components and glass underside

FPC:
- Exits bottom edge of display
- Bend radius ≥5mm
- Service loop slack 10–15mm
- Show strain relief (clamp tab or adhesive anchor)

Z-STACK REALITY CHECK:
- Show 12–15mm internal Z depth under glass plane (glass + gasket + clearance + PCB + component height + standoffs). No compressed spacing.

PRESENTATION:
- True exploded view with realistic spacing
- Orthographic or near-orthographic camera
- Neutral background
- No stylization, no extra parts, no labels.
