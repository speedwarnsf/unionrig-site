# Enclosure Phase-2 Brief (Geometry Lock)

This enclosure locks geometry prior to CNC aluminum production.

External envelope:
- 320 × 180 × 52 mm (W×D×H)

Includes:
- 4.2" portrait e-ink screen ledges and clamp
- 6-knob layout (Touch/Heat/Body | Depth/Motion/Tempo)
- 4 footswitches
- IEC C14 rear inlet (fit-only)
- Internal PCB + PSU keep-outs

If this assembles cleanly, CNC proceeds without redesign.
