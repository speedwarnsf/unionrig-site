## Union Rig
Trust what works.

Union Rig is a mono-in / stereo-out guitar instrument designed to help you shape sound without breaking your flow.

### A working set you can trust
Union Rig holds 12 sounds at a time. Each sound has two scenes (A/B) for within-song movement. No banks. No scrolling.

### Machines are useless if you can’t trust them.
Built for continuity: no dropouts, no reset feeling, no surprise behavior.
