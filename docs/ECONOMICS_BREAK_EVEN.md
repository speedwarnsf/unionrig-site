# Break-even Map (Working Assumptions Snapshot)

## Assumptions (baseline)
- Landed COGS (manufacturing + premium packaging): $180 / unit
- MSRP: $849
- Wholesale: $425 (~50% MSRP)
- Mix: 60% DTC / 40% wholesale

## Fixed costs (illustrative)
- Product + tooling + certification + jigs + pilot + launch overhead: ~$230,000

## Contribution margin (baseline)
- DTC: $849 - $180 - ~$55 (fees/fulfillment/support) ≈ $614
- Wholesale: $425 - $180 - ~$20 (dealer support/logistics) ≈ $225
- Weighted avg contribution: 0.6×614 + 0.4×225 ≈ $458

## Break-even units
